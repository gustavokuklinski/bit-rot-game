            Hello! I'm Marechal Souza! On head of NS_X0A6!
            We were luck to be here when the choper leave.

            Hope you are smart.
            Get my gear, I wont need them now.

            If you try to get the helichoper, keep in mind: 100.000 for the landing back.
            Be brave to try out.
            Well, for our luck we have an infinite stock of Vaccine.
            If someday it ends, or anyone need Vacs, I'll be here to serve
            those souls.

            You can try the tunnel. It goes to the Heli facility and the town.
            You can choose your path kiddo.

            This is a job for adults.
            I don't think Rio will come.

            Good luck!
